My web app, Gather-It, gives users a way to easily create grocery lists that help track your food
so that it can be eaten while it is still fresh. Previously purchased foods reappear on the list 
once they have expired, to make it even easier to remember what you need to purchase at the store.
Based on the foods on your list, you can search for recipes, prioritizing foods that will expire 
soonest. Gather-It is a great solution for those who frequently forget to buy things at the store,
or who let food go to waste because they forgot to eat it!

User Stories:
My mind goes blank when I enter a busy grocery store. I can never remember what I need to buy. 
A shopping list would be so helpful!

I forget when I buy certain things and then I buy them twice. I would like to avoid this.

Things go bad in my fridge. I would like some way of knowing that I should hurry up and eat that 
thing already!

Since I buy the same things on a weekly basis, I would like to have one list that contains the
items I buy week to week. I don't want to have to recreate my shopping list all the time.


 Site Flow:
A user signs up, and starts their shopping list. They add all the items they need to buy over the
days or weeks, including the useful life of each item. When they go to the store, they check things 
off their list as they purchase them, at which point, a progress bar shows them how much life their
items have left. During the week, they can see which items are getting closer to expiration and 
search for recipes that would include these items in the ingredients. When they are out of an item, 
they can check it again to indicate that they need to buy it. Or, when the food expires, it reappears
on their shopping list. The next time they go to the store, they will see what they need to buy since
last week, and they can add new items as needed.

API used  : Food2Fork

Wishlist:
It would be great to add the ability for one use to have many lists, or many users to colaborate 
on one list. I would also like to include other APIs for recipes since my results from Food2Fork 
were not always great.
